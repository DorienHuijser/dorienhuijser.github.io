Alarm bells go off. Researchers realize: oh dear, now I have to deal with the GDPR 1. I’ve seen this kind of response often, both in researchers as well as data support staff. As soon as personal data is on the table, more time is needed to plan a research project, more people need to be consulted, and more administrative work is usually involved. For researchers, taking into account privacy means that they need to spend valuable time and resources to make sure they are GDPR-compliant, and are limited in what they can and cannot do with the collected data. They experience the GDPR as a limitation, a monster to defeat before they can even start playing the game of research, let alone that of open science. Why, and what can we do about it?"

    "text": "The monster and scientific research\nIf you ask any privacy professional, they would tell you that the GDPR is actually very lenient in some respects when it comes to scientific research2. Some examples:\n\nPurpose limitation: further processing of personal data for research purposes is always compatible with the initial purpose of data collection, provided sufficient safeguards are in place (art. 5(1)(b)).\nStorage limitation: personal data need to be removed if they are not needed anymore, except if they need to be stored for scientific research purposes and sufficient safeguards are in place (art.5(1)(e)).\n\nSpecial categories of personal data: you can only use sensitive personal data3 in a few scenarios (art. 9(2)(j)). One of those is scientific research (provided safeguards are in place), another is explicit consent.\nRight to erasure: if a participants asks you to remove their data, you do not need to do that if it would “seriously impair” the achievement of the research purpose (art. 17(3)(d)).\n\nSo in reality, when one uses personal data for research, the GDPR is much more lenient than for, say, commercial companies. The GDPR is not so much as monster to defeat, as it is a creature to tame and keep happy. Yet, researchers I have generally been in touch with do see privacy as a time- and resource-intensive monster, to be fought with each time they want to use personal data. Why?"

    "text": "Taming the monster\nIn Dutch we say “zoveel mensen, zoveel wensen” (many people, many desires), and so there is most likely no one reason that all researchers who feel limited by the GDPR do so. But I can take a guess based on the survey and subsequent one-on-one conversations we held recently. The survey for example showed that:\n\nHaving personal data in a project means having to fill out many more administrative forms before one can start collecting data. For example, besides a data management plan, there is the ethics assessment, a privacy scan (sometimes called “privacy review”, “DPIA-light”, or “pre-DPIA”), and officially also an obligation to register the project in a processing registry.\nRoles, responsibilities and requirements are not always clear: who can help with figuring out how to set up a privacy-compliant project? Whose responsibility is it to be GDPR-compliant? What steps do researchers need to take before they can start collecting data?\nA distance between researchers, who just want to hear how they have to do things, and legal staff, who point out what researchers cannot do according to the law.\nExisting information is too abstract to use in research practice. Moreover, it is sometimes unclear which tools and techniques are available that would make things easier, or their learning curve is too steep for researchers to tackle on their own.\n\nThe GDPR “monster” is relatively new, and so are the strategies we have to tame it. The fact that support may not always be findable or helpful may simply be because up until recently, there was none. Moreover, while ethical committees have been in place for years, privacy offices haven’t, and so many researchers find help from a privacy professional only when the ethics committee tells them to. This can lead to some nasty situations, where in some cases entire projects that were ready to start data collection got blocked, because their plans were not GDPR-compliant."

But only all of them combined leads to a happy monster, or rather, a small pet that simply needed feeding5. Who knows, maybe handling personal data may end up as routine business for researchers, much like feeding your cat every day."

    "text": "Step 3: Customizing your website\nIt will probably take some time to get used to the way a Jekyll website is built, especially if you want to change more structural parts of it. In the latter case, some html knowledge would be useful, but I can assure you that Google is your best friend in this case (as it was for me)!\nStandard folders in a Jekyll website can be found here. Here’s some introductory tips how to personalize your website.\n\nGeneral steps during customization\n\nMake sure to move into the folder of the repository: cd githubusername.github.io\nMake sure you are working on the correct branch: git checkout [branchname] (e.g., master)\nTo see your changes locally, run bundle exec jekyll serve and open the URL that Jekyll provides in a browser, probably something like http://127.0.0.1:4000/\nIf you are happy with your change, stage the change: git add [filename] or git all -A . (if you want to stage ALL changes made)\nCommit your staged files: git commit -m \"Edit x\"\nPush your changes to your fork (online repository): git push origin [branch name]\n\n\n\nEditing pages and blogposts\n\nOpen the markdown (.md) files of the pages you want to edit - these may or may not be located in a pages folder (note that the index.md files is always the homepage.\nIf you want to create a blog post, create a new .md files in the _posts folder. Or if you don’t want to publish your post yet, in the _drafts folder.\nUse Atom, Typora or any other markdown editor (cheat sheet) to edit the pages\nIn order for your pages and posts to display correctly, be sure to include correct front matter in each page file (more info here)\n\n\n\nEditing the structure of the website\nThe structure of your website is determined largely by the following files:\n\n_config.yml contains all your website’s configuration details. You may want to set your title: “your website’s title”, slogan: “your slogan here”, description: “site description here and other details\nThe _data folder may include a navigation.yml file (or something similar) that defines the navigation menu on your website. It may also contain other data files that you can personalize, depending on the theme you are using. And of course you can create new ones to be used in pages through site.data.*nameOfDatafile*\nIf you keep including the same component on several pages, you can create includes. These are files that can be included on multiple pages without having to edit that component multiple times. Includes are therefore a way to make your website more modular, flexible and efficient as they prevent creating enormous page files.\n\nNote on .yml files: .yml files are terribly precise and give an error if you type even an extra space. Use a yaml validator (like this one to check where your .yml error is!\n\n\nEditing the looks of your website\n\nThe _layouts folder contains html files with layouts in which content is wrapped. If you change anything in these layouts, all pages using that layout are changed accordingly\nLayouts can also include files from the _includes folder, e.g., a sidebar.html or footer.html. Again, this increases the modularity and efficiency of your website, since all those components are specified separately\nIf you want to change colors, fonts, etc., you should go to the _sass folder. This usually contains some .scss files (a more modern version of the .css file) which specify all this."

    "text": "A knack to hack\nIn January, Open MR Benelux 2020 took place, a small-scale event for Benelux researchers who work with neuroimaging data and are interested in open science. This was where I joined my first hackathon and I was quite nervous about it. The word “hackathon” sounds very advanced and since I do not have much programming experience, I worried it was going to be a disaster. Luckily, the opposite turned out to be true.\n\n\nWhat are hackathons?\n\n\nThe word ‘hackathon’ originates from the programming world and stands for “hacking marathon”. Originally, hackathons are large meetings of smart people trying to build some kind of working software in a(n impossibly) small amount of time. Nowadays, an academic hackathon is typically a period in which academics collaborate fully on one specific project which will probably advance the field in one way or another. Admittedly, many projects do focus on developing tools, but they can also be tools that have nothing to do with programming. In fact, hackathon organizers increasingly stimulate making projects open to those with little coding experience. In recent hackathons, participants also do not only “hack”, but also have possibilities to follow training sessions and participate in “unconferences” – basically open and unplanned discussions for everyone to join. In this much more open way, hackathons are a great place to get to know new people, learn from them and have fun in the meantime.\n\n\n At OpenMR Benelux, I proposed our MRI guide as a hackathon project to receive more input. Despite the fact that there weren’t many participants to help, I received valuable input from an associate professor from Erasmus MC (Stefan Klein), who provided some more technical and medical insights. The rest of my time there, I spent helping with an existing initiative (eCOBIDAS). I was pleasantly surprised to realize that I learned more from my – very patient – collaborators than I imagined was possible in 3 days. Recently, I joined a second hackathon (OHBM Brainhack), which basically repeated this experience: I learned so many new things in a short amount of time. The best part about both these experiences wasn’t only to learn new skills. It was also getting to know colleagues and initiatives outside of the Netherlands that turned out to be very relevant to my own work. In addition, these events were both so informal and accessible that my embarrassment to ask things I didn’t know quickly faded.\nIn the meantime, the first version of the MRI data sharing guide has been published and we have already received feedback for a next version. My conclusion from this is that community-driven efforts, such as hackathons and our sharing guide, can contribute to scientific advancement in an extremely meaningful way. For me, this meant bringing the right people together to try to figure out the complicated issue that is sharing MRI data. For others, this may mean something different. Overall, I think that community-driven initiatives can have large impact, not only because they result from collaboration, but also because they have personal benefits: you can learn about projects happening in the world, get to know new people and collaborate on projects that you would otherwise never have thought about. It would be great if our MRI data sharing guide could be followed by something more widely applicable and will be just as widely supported as many preceding hackathon projects. In the meantime, I will keep on hacking.\nThis blog was originally posted on the Erasmus SYNC lab website"

This also meant figuring out how to deploy text files onto a website\n\n\n\nBy the way, I am far from technically skilled. But I will always be a Dutch person, and therefore I will always take an opportunity to do something without spending money on it. So in these collaborations, I slowly and steadily learned a few different ways to host a website for free! My confidence grew that it may actually be something I could do. It couldn’t be that hard, right?\n\n\nI was wrong.\n\n\nActually building a website\n\n\nAs a total html-noob, I got to work. Translation: I got to googling. Where did I put all those handy links again?\n\n\nWhen I finally found them, it seemed rather simple. I was lucky to already have all necessary software installed - I use Windows 10, which actually is a nightmare with all cool software project thingies. All I needed to do was choose a theme and fill the website with personal content, it seemed.\n\n\nOk, so that disappointed a little. I broke my navigation, removed critical html files and failed to include even simple hyperlinks in my text. Google truly became my best friend for literally everything. A small selection of search terms: “hyperlink html”, “yml file error”, “change background color html”, “center text”, etc.\n\n\nFinally…\n\n\nBecause I used my free time to make this website, I did not track how much time I spent on it. I can assure you, it is more like a couple of months than a couple of days. In Dutch, we say it is a process “van de lange adem” (“of the long breath”), basically meaning it is a long-term process.\n\n\nSo here it is! I’m still not entirely content with it, but: there is some basic functionality and some content. Google will remain my BFF though. I guess my main takeaway of this is that if a tutorial marks something as “easy”, I will probably still need a couple of days to get it. Oh wel, live and learn (a lot).\n\n\nWant to do this too?\n\nIf you only came here for yourself - who didn’t? - I also wrote a short introductory tutorial that shows how I got things to work. Hopefully, that will save you some precious time."

But when are data – and accompanying materials – useful?"

    "text": "FAIR enough?\nAt the moment, there are many degrees of practicing open science. Whereas some researchers simply share nothing, others throw their data somewhere on the internet and yet another small portion uses hardcore curation. The latter is the ultimate goal: data and code should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Despite this relatively simple sounding acronym, actually meeting the requirements of FAIR in practice turns out to be quite difficult.\nNo one should expect researchers to be able to do everything in the context of scientific research. This is where research supporters come in. Data stewards know a lot about research data management, because that is what they do! For example, they know how to deal with privacy sensitive data and how to anonymize them. They know how you can make sure to never lose previous versions of your files ever again. Perhaps most important for open science however: they know what is needed to make data FAIR. Although this all seems like boring stuff – which it sometimes is – it is crucial on the long term."

    "text": "The crucial cat concept\n\nTake metadata. If you share only your data, no one will be able to use them. Why? Because just the data alone do not tell you anything about the kind of data, the participants, what was measured and how. Others, including your future self, may not have a clue what the variable “var1” means in column X of your dataset. Metadata is here to provide this context. If we think of data as a picture of a cat, metadata is the date the picture was taken, the location, which camera made the picture and the file size, among others. You can take this very far at different levels, but I will not bore you with that. My point is that this requires consideration, because metadata are a prerequisite for the reuse of your data."

    "text": "Forever accessible\nAnother example concerns persistent identifiers. You may think: why can’t I just send my data to whomever interested? Or: Why can’t I just put my data on my personal website? However, this can lead to problems. Even though (no doubt!) your intentions are good, what if you leave your job and cannot access your 2008 data anymore? Or if you decide to use a different domain name for your website? In the latter case, all of the links to the data you put in your scientific article or that were sent to colleagues become invalid. Persistent identifiers are here to save the day, and research supporters play a crucial role in pointing researchers at these issues (you’re welcome).\nBy now, I hope that you agree with me that research data management is an important prerequisite for pushing open science forward. A solid basis of research data management will not only make science transparent, but also sustainable and reproducible in the long run. Luckily, more and more institutions see this and hire data stewards to help researchers achieve this. The science show must go on, but that is not possible without research data management as the secret star of the show.\n\nImages\n\nHeader image\nMetadata cat\n\nThis blog was originally posted on the Erasmus SYNC lab website"

Creating this guide was therefore a very different process compared to regular research. Specifically, it involved a lot less planning, first-time hackathon experiences and many teachable moments.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 6, 2020\n\n\nDorien Huijser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
