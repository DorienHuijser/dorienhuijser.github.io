      "As a research data manager, my job is to help researchers with their research data management questions and issues. 
      For different projects, this can mean different things. For example, I may help them with creating metadata, 
      taking care of privacy issues, making data <a href='https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/' target='_blank'>FAIR</a>, 
      writing a data management plan and thinking about data and code sharing."

    linkname: "coordination"
    description:
      "Besides doing data management-specific work, such as documentation, code writing, and helping researchers with their data management-related questions, 
      being a research data manager also entails a lot of coordination work. For example, in the  <a href='https://utrechtuniversity/github.io/dataprivacyproject' target = '_blank'>Data Privacy Project</a>,
      a lot of the work is basically coordinating with data support outside of the library, to get everyone on the same page and share knowledge and ideas. Similarly, in the 
      <a href='https://individualdevelopment.nl/2020/06/11/funding-for-harmonized-metadata-infrastructure/' target='_blank'>Connecting Data in Child Development</a> project,
      I am primarily coordinating the activities surrounding the collection and subsequent harmonization of the metadata we need from the involved cohort studies. This requires
      keeping the end goal in mind, keeping an overview of the entire project, and knowing what can be asked from which stakeholder / project member. Finally, within our department, improving
      our services always has to happen in concert with other departments or faculties, and thus constant communication between parts of the organization is necessary."
