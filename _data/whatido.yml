      "As a data steward, my job is to help researchers with their research data management questions and issues. 
      For different labs, this can mean different things. For example, I may help them with creating metadata, 
      taking care of privacy issues, making data <a href='https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/' target='_blank'>FAIR</a>, 
      helping to write a data management plan and thinking about code and software sharing."

      "I see research data management as part of open science, but not the entire story. There is more to open science than 'just' data sharing.
      For example, I think that open science means collaborating instead of competing, and being inclusive and transparent across the
      entire research cycle. See also Utrecht University's <a href='https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science' target='_blank'>vision on open science</a>, which is a good reflection of my own views."
