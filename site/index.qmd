Dorien Huijser is research data manager at the University Library at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. She provides support for researchers concerning the management of their research data. 

> As a research data manager, my job is to help researchers with their research data management questions and issues.
For different projects, this can mean different things. For example, I can help with writing a Data Management Plan, adding documentation and metadata, 
taking care of privacy issues, making data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), working with version control, and writing reproducible code and articles.
