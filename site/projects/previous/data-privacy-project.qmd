Between July 2021 and June 2023, I led a university-wide project about privacy in research. Together with many colleagues from different disciplines (data management, privacy, security, open science, ethics, communication), we worked on four deliverables which I am now still maintaining.

- The [Data Privacy Handbook](https://uu.nl/privacyhandbook) [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8005847)], an open source wiki about privacy in research for Utrecht University researchers and beyond.
- A [survey and one-on-one interviews](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacysurvey/) [[DOI]( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7253451)] to ask researchers about their struggles and needs with respect to privacy in research.
- An [overview of tools](https://github.com/utrechtUniversity/privacy-engineering-tools) [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7950409)] that can help when working with personal data
- An online module [Privacy Basics for Researchers](https://uu.nl/privacybasics) [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7930571)] which is now part of the RDM Support curriculum.

Besides these deliverables, the project had a positive effect on the data support community at Utrecht University. It allowed us to form new collaborations or strengthen existing ones.
