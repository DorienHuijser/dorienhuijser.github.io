Since 2025, I have joined the Open Science NL-funded project "[National training and community platform for research data professionals](https://researchdata.nl/en/national-training-and-community-platform-for-research-data-professionals/)" which runs from 2025 until 2028 within the Research Data Netherlands consortium, consisting of 4TU.ResearchData, DANS-KNAW, SURF and Health-RI.

This project consists of four work packages:

- WP1: Project communication and coordination
- WP2: 
  - Developing a data steward curriculum and providing certification
  - Developing new data steward training
  - Teaching courses
  - Developing train-the-trainer materials
- WP3: Delivery of the platform
- WP4: Sustainability and governance of the platform

At the moment, my involvement is primarily in WP2.
