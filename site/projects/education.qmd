I regularly (co)teach standard and custom workshops about Research Data Management, reproducibility, R programming, and working with Quarto. I am also involved in creating the materials for these workshops and making the materials publicly available under an open license.

Here are the workshops that I currently (can) teach:

- Quickstart to Research Data Management ([materials](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7152332))
- Introduction to R and Data ([materials](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-introduction-to-R-and-data/))
- Getting started with Yoda ([materials](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10785359))
- Writing Reproducible Manuscripts with R and Python ([materials](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/))

Here are the online materials that I (co)manage at the moment:

- [Write your DMP](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/training-workshops/online-training-learn-to-write-your-dmp) (online module)
- [Privacy Basics for Researchers](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/workshops/privacy-basics-online-training) ([online module](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7930571))
- Research Data Management Support website ([uu.nl/rdm](https://uu.nl/rdm))
