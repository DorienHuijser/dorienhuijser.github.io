### CV (old)

**Work experience**

- Research data manager @ Utrecht University Library, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands
   - 2021-current
   - As a research data manager, I support researchers at the university with their data management and open data-related issues. Typical topics include data storage, privacy, metadata, making data and software FAIR, reproducibility, version control, etc.
- Lab and data manager @  Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected ([SYNC lab](https://erasmus-synclab.nl/), Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
   - 2020-2021
   - As **data manager**, I formulated ways to move towards open science practices and looked at how the group handled their research data (privacy, data structure, long-term access, etc.) and how we could improve that. In both data management and open science, I tried to educate myself as much as possible and keep a close eye on international developments, connecting with researchers and support staff from national and international institutions. As **lab manager**, I coordinated and supported all kinds of lab-wide events and initiatives, including (but not limited to): organizing meetings, functioning as liaison between the SYNC lab and EUR's research support staff, improving how we worked (incl. with data), involvement in the citizen science platform [YoungXperts](https://youngxperts.nl), where youth are actively involved in the group's research during brainstorms and cocreation sessions
- Data manager @ Leiden Consortium on Individual Development ([L-CID](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/social-and-behavioural-sciences/leiden-consortium-on-individual-development-l-cid)), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands
   - 2020-2021
   - As data manager for L-CID, a large multi-cohort twin study, I helped make the data and metadata [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and their documentation interpretable, in order for this amazing dataset to be useful and useable in the future.
- Data manager @ [Brain and Development Research Center](https://brainanddevelopment.nl/), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands
   - 2019-2020
   - In this developmental psychology group, I helped researchers transition towards applying better data management and open research practices, such as folder structures and versioning, preregistration, data sharing and privacy issues. I continued this job when the Research Center was split up into the [SYNC lab](https://erasmus-synclab.nl) and the [CHANGE Leiden](https://changeleiden.nl) research platform.
- Educational content developer and e-moderator @ [Utrecht University Medical Center](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/educational-expertise) and [Animal Welfare Body Utrecht](https://www.ivd-utrecht.nl/en), Utrecht, The Netherlands
   - 2019-2020
   - In the development and testing phase of the learning track [My Animal Research: Experimental Design](https://www.uu.nl/en/events/my-animal-research-experimental-design-fully-booked), a learning track for PhD students who are setting up an animal experiment, I developed the contents of the online learning environment and functioned as e-moderator during the pilot phase of the project (Sept.-Dec. 2019), keeping contact with all involved participants, teachers and coordinators.
- Several side jobs
   - 2010-2019
   - During my secondary school and university studies, I had several side jobs:
      - 2016-2019: Tutor for several secondary school pupils in several subjects (e.g, maths, chemistry, Latin, Greek)
      - 2018-2019: Student assistant on the [Brainlinks](https://juniorhersenen.nl/onderzoeken/brainlinks/) project at the [Brain and Development Research Center](https://brainanddevelopment.nl/), Leiden University
