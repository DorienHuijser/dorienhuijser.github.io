# About

I love working with scientists to learn about their research while simultaneously helping them make their work more open, reproducible and compliant.
I enjoy having a variety of tasks, including teaching, consulting, and in-depth data management work.
Collaborating with other data support staff and with researchers are among the highlights of my working week.
I am an excellent organizer, very eager to learn and to help others, goal-oriented and a reliable and dedicated colleague.
