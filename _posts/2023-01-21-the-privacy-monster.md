These and many more questions like this enter our inbox regularly. Alarm bells go off. Researchers realize: 
*oh dear, now I have to deal with the GDPR* [^1]. I've seen this kind of response often, both in researchers 
as well as data support staff. As soon as personal data is on the table, more time is needed to plan a 
research project, more people need to be consulted, and more administrative work is usually involved. 
For researchers, taking into account privacy means that they need to spend valuable time and resources to make 
sure they are GDPR-compliant, and are limited in what they can and cannot do with the collected data. They 
experience the GDPR as a limitation, a monster to defeat before they can even start playing the game of 
research, let alone that of open science. Why, and what can we do about it? 

## The monster and scientific research
If you ask any privacy professional, they would tell you that the GDPR is actually very lenient in 
some respects when it comes to scientific research[^2]. Some examples:

- **Purpose limitation**: <br>further processing of personal data for research purposes is always compatible 
with the initial purpose of data collection, provided sufficient safeguards are in place (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/" target="_blank">art. 5(1)(b)</a>).
- **Storage limitation**: <br>personal data need to be removed if they are not needed anymore, except if 
they need to be stored for scientific research purposes and sufficient safeguards are in place (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/" target="_blank">art.5(1)(e)</a>).  
- **Special categories of personal data**: <br>you can only use sensitive personal data[^3]  in a few scenarios 
(<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/" target="_blank">art. 9(2)(j)</a>). One of those is scientific 
research (provided safeguards are in place), another is explicit consent. 
- **Right to erasure**: <br>if a participants asks you to remove their data, you do not need to do that if it 
would "seriously impair" the achievement of the research purpose (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/" target="_blank">art. 17(3)(d)</a>).

So in reality, when one uses personal data for research, the GDPR is much more lenient than for, say, commercial companies. 
The GDPR is not so much as monster to defeat, as it is a creature to tame and keep happy. Yet, researchers I have generally 
been in touch with do see privacy as a time- and resource-intensive monster, to be fought with each time they want to use 
personal data. Why?

## Taming the monster
In Dutch we say "zoveel mensen, zoveel wensen" (many people, many desires), and so there is most likely no one reason that 
all researchers who feel limited by the GDPR do so. But I can take a guess based on the 
<a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacysurvey/docs/data-privacy-survey-report.html" target="_blank">survey and subsequent one-on-one conversations</a> 
we held recently. The survey for example showed that:

- Having personal data in a project means having to fill out many more administrative forms before one can start collecting data. 
For example, besides a data management plan, there is the ethics assessment, a privacy scan (sometimes called "privacy review", "DPIA-light", 
or "pre-DPIA"), and officially also an obligation to register the project in a processing registry.
- Roles, responsibilities and requirements are not always clear: who can help with figuring out how to set up a privacy-compliant 
project? Whose responsibility is it to be GDPR-compliant? What steps do researchers need to take before they can start collecting data?
- A distance between researchers, who just want to hear *how* they have to do things, and legal staff, who point out what 
researchers *cannot* do according to the law.
- Existing information is too abstract to use in research practice. Moreover, it is sometimes unclear which tools 
and techniques are available that would make things easier, or their learning curve is too steep for researchers to tackle on their own.

The GDPR "monster" is relatively new, and so are the strategies we have to tame it. The fact that support may not always be 
findable or helpful may simply be because up until recently, *there was none*. Moreover, while ethical committees have been in place for years, 
privacy offices haven't, and so many researchers find help from a privacy professional only when the ethics committee tells them to. This 
can lead to some nasty situations, where in some cases entire projects that were ready to start data collection got blocked, because their 
plans were not GDPR-compliant.

## How can we make it easier?
The way I see it, privacy professionals can take the approach of ethics committees as an example: give researchers a recipe and all the 
ingredients to keep the monster happy:

- Provide clear instructions on what steps to take when.
- Provide ready to (re)use solutions, i.e., documents, workflows and technical solutions without a steep learning curve.
- Provide smooth and low-threshold in-person support.

Some of these ingredients may already be there - or in development[^4] - and some may be combined with other recipes such 
as that of ethics applications and data management plans. But only all of them combined leads to a happy monster, or rather, 
a small pet that simply needed feeding[^5]. Who knows, maybe handling personal data may end up as routine business for 
researchers, much like feeding your cat every day.
