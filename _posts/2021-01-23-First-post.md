Welcome to my personal website! As this is my first blogpost, I'll try to explain why and how I created this website.

<h2>How it started: <i>"Cool, my own website!"</i></h2>

<p>At the start of 2020, I came across a <a href="https://www.dsquintana.blog/create-an-academic-website-free-easy-2020/">tutorial</a> by Dan Quintana to create a personal website via GitHub. As I had just started learning how to use git and GitHub at <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io/">OpenMR Benelux 2020</a>, I thought: <q><em>let's save this resource for later</em></q>.</p> 
<p>Of course, in practice this  meant simply leaving the tab open on my phone for ages.</p>

<p>Some ages and 20 tabs later, I figured my phone battery would be much better off if I closed some tabs. The tutorial now moved from my phone to my never-ending to do list, where it risked complete neglect and finally, removal. However, in the summer, I joined a few projects where I got into GitHub again: </p>

<ol>
    <li>I volunteered for website maintenance at the <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/">OHBM Hackathon 2020</a>, which took a lot more time than I thought, but did result in major GitHub activity:

    <li>I joined the organizing committee of OpenMR Benelux 2021, where we also started updating the <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io">website</a> for the new 2021 edition</li>
    <li>Together with my colleague Eduard, we started a <a href="https://eur-synclab.github.io">wiki</a> for our lab (the SYNC lab) with all kinds of useful information surrounding our research. This also meant figuring out how to deploy text files onto a website</li>
</ol>

<p>By the way, <i>I am far from technically skilled</i>. But I will always be a Dutch person, and therefore I will always take an opportunity to do something without spending money on it. So in these collaborations, I slowly and steadily learned a few different ways to host a website for free! My confidence grew that it may actually be something I could do. It couldn't be that hard, right?</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<h2>Actually building a website</h2>

<p>As a total html-noob, I got to work. Translation: I got to googling. Where did I put all those handy links again?</p>

<p>When I finally found them, it seemed rather simple. I was lucky to already have all necessary software installed - I use Windows 10, which actually is a <i>nightmare</i> with all cool software project thingies. All I needed to do was choose a theme and fill the website with personal content, it seemed.</p>

<p>Ok, so that disappointed a little. I broke my navigation, removed critical html files and failed to include even simple hyperlinks in my text. Google truly became my best friend for literally <i>everything</i>. A small selection of search terms: "<code>hyperlink html</code>", "<code>yml file error</code>", "<code>change background color html</code>", "<code>center text</code>", etc.</p>  

<h2>Finally...</h2>

<p>Because I used my free time to make this website, I did not track how much time I spent on it. I can assure you, it is more like a couple of months than a couple of days. In Dutch, we say it is a process "<i>van de lange adem</i>" ("of the long breath"), basically meaning it is a long-term process.</p>

<p>So here it is! I'm still not entirely content with it, but: there is some basic functionality and some content. Google will remain my BFF though. I guess my main takeaway of this is that if a tutorial marks something as "easy", I will probably still need a couple of days to get it. Oh wel, live and learn (a lot).</p>

<h2>Want to do this too?</h2>

If you only came here for yourself - who didn't? - I will soon write a short introductory tutorial that shows how I got things to work. Hopefully, that will save you some precious time.
