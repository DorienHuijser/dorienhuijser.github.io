# Personal website

This is the Github repository for my personal website. You can here find the files and folders behind [http://www.dorienhuijser.com/](http://www.dorienhuijser.com/).

This website uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [journal](https://bootswatch.com/journal/) Bootswatch theme.
The CV was built using the Quarto extension [modern2-cv](https://github.com/schochastics/modern2-cv).
