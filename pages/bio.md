<p> I started my career at Utrecht University in the bachelor <a href="https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/liberal-arts-and-sciences">Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>). Here, I learned about the importance of <b>interdisciplinary cooperation</b> as a way to solve society's larger issues. Besides learning tools for integrating multiple perspectives, I dove into <b>Cognitive and neurobiological psychology</b> (major) and <b>Language development</b> (minor).</p>

<p><img src="../images/nc.jpg" style="zoom:80%;" /></p>
<p>With my newly acquired knowledge, I applied for the master <a href="https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/neuroscience-and-cognition">Neuroscience and Cognition</a>. During my master's, I conducted two <b>research projects</b> in both cognitive (9 months) and developmental psychology (6 months). Additionally, I decided to extend my master with a minor in <b>science education and communication</b>, where I gained skills in communicating science to different audiences.</p>

<p><img src="../images/previouswork.jpg" style="zoom:80%;" /></p>
<p>After my master's, I started as <b>data manager</b> at the Brain and Development Research Center ánd as <b>educational content creator</b> and e-moderator at University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC). In these positions, I was able to combine promoting good research practices with creating educational scientific content for a PhD audience.</p>

<p><img src="../images/currentwork.jpg" style="zoom:80%;" /></p>
<p>Currently, I work as a research assistant at Erasmus University Rotterdam (<a href="https://www.eur.nl/people/dorien-huijser">EUR</a>) and Leiden University <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/dorien-huijser">LU</a>)). My job includes:
     <ul>
    <li><strong>Data management</strong> (EUR and LU): I formulate ways to move towards <strong>open science practices</strong> in the <a href="http://erasmus-synclab.nl/">SYNC lab</a> (Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected at EUR) and in the Leiden Consortium on Individual Development (L-CID, LU) project. As a prerequisite for open science practices, I also look at how we handle our research data (privacy, data structure, long-term access, etc.) and how we can improve that. In both areas, I try to educate myself as much as possible and keep a close eye on international developments, connecting with researchers and support staff from national and international institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Lab management</strong> and support (EUR): I help researchers with figuring out scientific procedures, organizing labmeetings, keeping notes, communicating with EUR's research support staff, thinking about how we can improve how we work, etc. Additionally, I also play a role in setting up our citizen science platform, <a href="https://youngxperts.nl">"YoungXperts"</a>, where youth are actively involved in our research during brainstorms and cocreation sessions.</li>
</ul></p>
