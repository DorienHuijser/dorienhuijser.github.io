<p>Currently, I work as a research assistant at Erasmus University Rotterdam (<a href="https://www.eur.nl/people/dorien-huijser">EUR</a>) and Leiden University <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/dorien-huijser">LU</a>)). My job includes:

<ul>
    <li>Data management (EUR and LU): in this position, I try to formulate ways to move towards open science practices in the <a href="http://erasmus-synclab.nl/">SYNC lab</a> (Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected at EUR) and in the Leiden Consortium on Individual Development (L-CID, LU) project. As a prerequisite for open science practices, I also look at how we handle our research data (privacy, data structure, long-term access, etc.) and how we can improve that. In both areas, I try to educate myself as much as possible and keep a close eye on international developments, connecting with researchers and support staff from national and international institutions.</li>
<li>Lab management and support (EUR): in this position, I help researchers with figuring out scientific procedures, organizing labmeetings, keeping notes, communicating with EUR's research support staff, thinking about how we can improve how we work, etc. Additionally, I also play a role in setting up our citizen science platform, <a href="https://youngxperts.nl">YoungXperts</a>, where youth are actively involved in setting up our research and scientific output during brainstorms and cocreation sessions. </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Read more on what I do <a href="../what-i-do">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p> I started my career at Utrecht University in the bachelor <a href="https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/liberal-arts-and-sciences">Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>). Here, I learned about the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation as a way to solve society's larger issues. Besides learning tools for integrating multiple perspectives, I dove into Cognitive and neurobiological psychology (major) and Language development (minor).</p>

<p>With my newly acquired knowledge, I applied for the master <a href="https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/neuroscience-and-cognition">Neuroscience and Cognition</a>. During my master's, I conducted two research projects in both cognitive (9 months) and developmental psychology (6 months). Additionally, I decided to extend my master with a minor in science education and communication, where I gained skills in communicating science to different audiences.</p>

<p>After my master's, I started as data manager at the Brain and Development Research Center ánd as educational content creator and e-moderator at University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC). In these positions, I was able to combine promoting good research practices with creating educational scientific content for a PhD audience.</p>
