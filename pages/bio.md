## Bio

Currently, I work as a research assistant at Erasmus University Rotterdam ([EUR](https://www.eur.nl/people/dorien-huijser)) and Leiden University ([LU](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/dorien-huijser#tab-1)). My job includes:

- Data management (EUR and LU): in this position, I try to formulate ways to move towards open science practices in the [SYNC lab](http://erasmus-synclab.nl/) (Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected at EUR) and in the Leiden Consortium on Individual Development (L-CID, LU) project. As a prerequisite for open science practices, I also look at how we handle our research data (privacy, data structure, long-term access, etc.) and how we can improve that. In both areas, I try to educate myself as much as possible and keep a close eye on international developments, connecting with researchers and support staff from national and international institutions.
- Lab management and support (EUR): in this position, I help researchers with figuring out scientific procedures, organizing labmeetings, keeping notes, communicating with EUR's research support staff, thinking about how we can improve how we work, etc. Additionally, I also play a role in setting up our citizen science platform, [YoungXperts](https://youngxperts.nl), where youth are actively involved in setting up our research and scientific output during brainstorms and cocreation sessions.

      <p> I started my career at Utrecht University in the bachelor <a href=https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/liberal-arts-and-sciences>Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>. Here, I learned about the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation as a way to solve society's larger issues. Besides learning tools for integrating multiple perspectives, I dove into Cognitive and neurobiological psychology (major) and Language development (minor).</p>

          <p>With my newly acquired knowledge, I applied for the master <a href=https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/neuroscience-and-cognition>Neuroscience and Cognition</a>. During my master's, I conducted two research projects in both cognitive (9 months) and developmental psychology (6 months). Additionally, I decided to extend my master with a minor in science education and communication, where I gained skills in communicating science to different audiences.</p>

After my master's, I started as data manager at the Brain and Development Research Center Ã¡nd as educational content creator and e-moderator at University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC). In these positions, I was able to combine promoting good research practices with creating educational scientific content for a PhD audience.
