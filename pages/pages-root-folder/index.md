        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Dorien. I am currently a research data manager at the Utrecht University Library, providing support for researchers
          surrounding the management of their data. In the past, I was the data manager in a developmental neuroscience group, where I focused
          on not only data management, but also other aspects of open science (e.g., data sharing, publishing open access, preregistrations, etc.)
          within the field of developmental neuroscience. I also have some educational experience in developing and moderating a online course 
          on designing animal experiments, and tutoring high schoolers. During my studies, I gained
          experience in, among others, working in an interdisciplinary way and performing research myself. These experiences have helped me
          navigate my current job. However, I'm always looking for more skills to learn during both my professional and personal journey!
