      <li>As <strong>data manager</strong>, I am the bridge between developmental psychologists (at the <a href="http://erasmus-synclab.nl/">SYNC lab</a> and the <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/onderzoek/onderzoeksprojecten/sociale-wetenschappen/leiden-consortium-on-individual-development-l-cid">L-CID study</a>) and their aims to work more in line with principles of <strong>open science</strong>. I help them get more information, look for new research tools and connect with other researchers and support staff about struggles we run into.</li>
    <li>As <strong>lab manager</strong>, I am the bridge between researchers and university-wide support staff to get practical things done. Moreover, I help with our <strong>citizen science</strong> initiative "YoungXperts", building a two-way bridge between our science and society.</li>
