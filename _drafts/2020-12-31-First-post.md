Welcome on my personal website! As this is my first blogpost, I'll try to explain how I made this website... 

<h2>How it started: Cool my own website!</h2>

<p>At the beginning of 2020, I came across a <a href="https://www.dsquintana.blog/create-an-academic-website-free-easy-2020/">tutorial</a> by Dan Quintana to create a personal website via GitHub. As I had just started learning how to use git and GitHub at <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io/">OpenMR Benelux 2020</a>, I thought: <q><em>let's save this resource for later</em></q>. Of course, in practice this  meant simply leaving the tab open on my phone for ages.</p>

<p>Some ages and 20 tabs later, I figured my phone battery would be much better off if I closed some tabs. The tutorial now moved from my phone to my never-ending to do list, where it risked complete neglect and finally, removal. However, in the summer, I joined a few projects where I got into GitHub again: </p>

<ol>
    <li>I volunteered for website maintenance at the <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/">OHBM Hackathon 2020</a>, which took a lot more time than I thought, but did result in major GitHub activity:
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At the start of 2020, I attended a git(hub) tutorial by the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/sofie_vdbos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sofie_vdbos</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/RemiGau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RemiGau</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/openmrbenelux?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@openmrbenelux</a> as a total noob üíÄ <br><br>Now, I&#39;m proud to have learned the true meaning of commitment (ha), which apparently results in art pieces like these üòÅ‚¨áÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/nEgIvr1NQs">pic.twitter.com/nEgIvr1NQs</a></p>&mdash; Dorien Huijser (@DorienHuijser) <a href="https://twitter.com/DorienHuijser/status/1331353860057731074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></li>
    <li>I joined the organizing committee of OpenMR Benelux 2021, where we also started updating the <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io">website</a> for the new 2021 edition</li>
    <li>Together with my colleague Eduard, we started a <a href="https://github.com/eur-synclab/sync-wiki">wiki</a> for our lab (the SYNC lab) with all kinds of useful information surrounding our research. This also meant figuring out how to deploy text files onto a website</li>
</ol>

<p>By the way, <b>I am far from technically literate</b>. But I will always be a Dutch person, as in: I will always take an opportunity to do something without spending money on it. So in these collaborations, I slowly and steadily learned a few different ways to host a website for free! My confidence grew that it may actually be something I could do. It couldn't be that hard, right?</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<h2>Actually building a website</h2>

<p>As a total html-noob, I got to work. Translation: I got to googling. Where did I put all those handy links again?</p>

<p>When I finally found them, it seemed rather simple. I was lucky to already have all necessary software installed - I use Windows 10, which actually is a nightmare with all cool software project thingies. All I needed to do was choose a theme and fill the website with personal content, it seemed.</p>

<p>Ok, so that disappointed a little. I broke my navigation, removed critical html files and failed to include even simple hyperlinks in my text. Google truly became my best friend for literally <i>everything</i>. A small selection of search terms: "<code>hyperlink html</code>", "<code>yml file error</code>", "<code>change background color html</code>", "<code>center text</code>", etc.</p>  

<h2>Finally...</h2>

<p>So now there is a website. I'm still not entirely content with it, but: there is some basic functionality and some content. Google will remain my BFF though. I guess my main takeaway of this is that if a tutorial marks something as "easy", I will probably still need a couple of days to get it. Oh wel, live and learn.</p>

<h2>Want to do this too?</h2>

<p>If you only came here for yourself - who didn't? - here are some useful resources if you want to build your own website too:
